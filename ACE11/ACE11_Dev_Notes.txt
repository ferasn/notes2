  * Integration Node (also known as the integration broker): An integration node is a system service on Windows, a daemon process on UNIX, or a started task on z/OS. It controls processes that run message flows.
  * Integration Server: is a named grouping of message flows that are assigned to an integration node. Each integration server is started as a separate operating system process, providing an isolated runtime environment for a set of deployed message flows.
