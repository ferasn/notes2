* A process instance that is blocked doing executing a synchrounous invocation activity (HTTP call on import) cannot be terminated until
the activity is completed either successfully or with failure.  Trying to force terminate the instance, the BPC will report an error that
the instance failed to terminate.

* In failed events: 
Exception reason: CWSIK0035E: A message cannot be delivered to destination sca/Reconciliation on messaging engine MECluster.000-BPM.PServer_DE.Bus because it has rolled back more times than its redelivery threshold.

This exception means that there is a problem with the messaging engine preventing the message from being put on the destination queue
(sca/Reconciliation).  Look at messaging engine logs to find out the problem.

* Invocation activity that is asynchronous uses SIBus destinations of the module to send the request.  The activity failes with this error "com.ibm.websphere.sca.ServiceRuntimeException - Send destination invalid.", then check
if the SIBus security is enabled and the application has the right role mapped to its jms resource references.
Note: when this issue happened, nothing was written to the logs. Try to reproduce it and investigate which compoenent log level needs to be increased to catch the root cause.
