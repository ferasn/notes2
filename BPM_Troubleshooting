* A process instance that is blocked doing executing a synchrounous invocation activity (HTTP call on import) cannot be terminated until
the activity is completed either successfully or with failure.  Trying to force terminate the instance, the BPC will report an error that
the instance failed to terminate.

* In failed events: 
Exception reason: CWSIK0035E: A message cannot be delivered to destination sca/Reconciliation on messaging engine MECluster.000-BPM.PServer_DE.Bus because it has rolled back more times than its redelivery threshold.

This exception means that there is a problem with the messaging engine preventing the message from being put on the destination queue
(sca/Reconciliation).  Look at messaging engine logs to find out the problem.
